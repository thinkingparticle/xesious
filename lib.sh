#
# THE RULE THIS FILE EXISTS TO ENFORCE: never signal a process on a *negative*
# match. A pid is ours only when BOTH checks positively succeed — it is owned by
# this uid, and its cwd reads back as exactly the directory we care about.
#
# Why that phrasing matters. This box really is multi-user: two xesious
# deployments run right now, one as `ops` and one as `dev`. Today the only
# thing stopping a redeploy from killing the other person's bot is that
# /proc/<pid>/cwd needs ptrace access to read, so the comparison quietly fails and
# the process is skipped. That is a kernel side effect, not a decision — and it
# evaporates the moment any of this runs as root, which this deployment already
# contemplates. So an unreadable /proc entry is treated as "definitively not
# mine" by design here, which keeps the current behaviour correct rather than
# lucky.

# The same rule as for pids, because the same bug was here: `tmux kill-session -t
# "$SESSION"` trusted a NAME. Two deployments by one user both default to
# `claude-tg`, so a redeploy in directory B tore down the bridge in directory A —
# the pid loop would politely decline to touch it and the next line killed its
# session anyway.
#
# Identifying the session by its working directory is NOT sufficient, and on this
# box it is actively dangerous. Verified: two sessions share /home/dev/xesious

# operator's own interactive session. A directory match would kill it.
#
# So a session is ours only on THREE positive proofs: its pane process is owned by
# us, its cwd is our directory, and its command line is the respawn wrapper (it
# mentions bridge.ts). That also holds when the bridge itself is momentarily dead
