"""Speak an answer as a SEQUENCE of voice notes, emitted as each one is ready.

Reads one JSON object on stdin and writes one JSON object per line to stdout:

    in : {"units":[{"text":"Results.","gap":0.55}, ...],
          "outdir":"/tmp/x", "chunks":[45,90,180]}
    out: {"chunk":1,"path":"/tmp/x/part-1.ogg","seconds":47.2,"at":0.0}
         {"chunk":2,"path":"/tmp/x/part-2.ogg","seconds":91.0,"at":47.2}
         {"full":"/tmp/x/full.ogg","seconds":138.2,"chunks":2,
          "timings":[[0.0,4.1],[4.6,12.3], ...]}

`timings` is one [start, end] per unit, in the finished audio. It is exact rather
than estimated — every unit was synthesised here, so its length is known — and it is
what the caller turns into a section index for the caption and into the highlighting
of the read-along page. Computing it costs nothing; it used to be thrown away.

Pass {"out":"/path/one.ogg"} instead of "outdir" for the single-file case — one
utterance, one file, no chunking. That mode exists so this is the ONLY place in the
tree that loads Kokoro: voice/tts.sh delegates to it rather than carrying a second
implementation that reads the same nine environment variables.

Why this exists rather than another call to tts.sh:

  * The topic used to be BLOCKED for the whole synthesis — measured at 65s for a
    note at the old 1400-character cap. Emitting chunks as they finish is what lets
    the first audio arrive in ~30 seconds instead of after everything.
  * The model is loaded ONCE for the whole answer. tts.sh spawns a fresh process
    per note, so the 311MB ONNX model was reconstructed every time: 2 of those 65
    seconds were model load, per note.
  * Pauses have to be real silence. Kokoro honours punctuation only weakly and has
    no SSML, so a heading is followed by appending zeros to the sample array — which
    is only possible when synthesis and joining happen in the same process.
  * The full file at the end costs nothing here: the samples are already in hand,
    so it is a concatenate and one encode, not a second synthesis.

Env: TG_KOKORO_MODEL / TG_KOKORO_VOICES / TG_KOKORO_VOICE / TG_KOKORO_SPEED /
     TG_KOKORO_LANG, and TG_FFMPEG to override the encoder.
