"""
Tier 3 staging driver: a Telegram USER client that drives the staging bridge over
REAL Telegram and asserts on the bot's replies.

Why a user account and not a bot: bots never receive other bots' messages, so a bot
could not talk to the bridge. This logs in as the dedicated test account (via the
StringSession from gen_session.py), DMs the staging bot, and checks what comes back.

Deterministic by default: run-staging.sh points the staging bridge's CLAUDE_BIN at
test/claude-stub.ts, so the model layer is canned and replies are stable ("okReply").
Set STAGING_REAL_CLAUDE=1 to instead exercise the real `claude` with a compliance
prompt (a looser, non-hermetic smoke test).

Env (set by run-staging.sh from .env.staging):
    TG_API_ID, TG_API_HASH, TG_TEST_SESSION   — the user client's credentials
    STAGING_BOT_USERNAME                       — @username of the staging bot to DM
    STAGING_REPLY_TIMEOUT                       — seconds to wait per reply (default 60)
    STAGING_REAL_CLAUDE                         — "1" to test against real claude

    long reply off around a fifth of the way in, mid-sentence, saying nothing. And
    *"my next messages in Telegram will be ignored until the voice is generated"* —
    synthesis sat inside the turn, measured at 65 seconds of dead topic for a note at
    that very cap.

    This is the case that CANNOT be faked: it is about real synthesis taking real
    time. Tier 2 stubs the engine and proves the plumbing; only here do the notes
    actually arrive one after another while the topic keeps answering.

    ON ITS LENGTH. This used to ask for 150 spoken lines and took about ten minutes,
    because two unrelated requirements were being met by the same string: the answer
    had to exceed TG_REPLY_FILE_CHARS (6000) to take the FILE-GROUP path, and it had
    to be spoken long enough to produce more than one chunk. Six thousand characters
    of prose is nine minutes of audio, and eight of those minutes proved nothing that
    the first two had not.

    They are now met separately. speechBlocks() renders a fenced code block as the
    single sentence "A N-line code block." — so the block supplies the characters at
    a cost of about two seconds of speech, while a short run of prose supplies the
    audio. Same file-group path, same ramp, same assertions, roughly a fifth of the
    wall clock.

    The truncation half of the first report moved to tier 2, where it is checked
    exactly rather than inferred: a duration floor here could never distinguish a
    whole answer from one sliced at 1400 characters, because that slice is still
    about two minutes of perfectly good audio. See "the chunked path speaks the WHOLE
    answer" in test/bridge.e2e.test.ts, which reads the units handed to the
