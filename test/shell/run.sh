# Tier 0 — unit tests for lib.sh, the deploy scripts' process-selection primitives.
#
# This is the tier the project did not have. Tiers 1-3 all exercise TypeScript;
# nothing covered the shell, which is precisely where a mistake kills someone
# else's bot. These are the rules worth pinning, since every one of them was
# broken in at least one script:
#   * a process must be OURS (uid) and in OUR directory before it is ever signalled
#   * an unreadable /proc entry means "not mine", not "probably fine"
#   * an empty directory argument must select NOTHING, never everything
#
# Hermetic and safe to run on a box with live bridges: every process it creates
# is a throwaway `sleep` in a temp directory, and every assertion is scoped to
# those temp directories, so a real bridge (whose cwd is the repo) is never
# selected, never signalled, and never even a candidate. Run with:
#   bash test/shell/run.sh
