/**
 * claude-tg-bridge — drive the Claude Code CLI from Telegram, one session per topic.
 *
 * Each (chat, forum-topic) maps to its own working DIRECTORY and its own
 * resumable Claude Code session. A message in a topic runs
 *   claude -p "<text>" --resume <session_id> --output-format json
 * inside that topic's directory; the reply is posted back into the same topic.
 *
 * Because each topic has a dedicated directory, you can also drop into it on the
 * server and continue the very same conversation:
 *   cd <TG_SESSIONS_BASE>/<topic-name> && claude --continue
 *
 * No API key: the CLI uses your existing claude.ai (Pro/Max) login.
 * No MCP / channels: this is a plain Telegram bot that shells out to `claude`.
 * History persists at ~/.claude/projects/<encoded-cwd>/<session-id>.jsonl
 *
 * Config comes from the environment (and a sibling .env). See .env.example.

// Telegram permits exactly one open getUpdates per TOKEN, and the 409 it returns

// token, and each getUpdates confirms an offset for everything before it, so two
// pollers consume from the same queue: every message goes to whichever instance
// happens to be polling at that moment. A conversation silently splits across two
// processes with different session bindings, working directories and state files.
//
// PID_FILE above cannot see that. It is scoped to the state directory, so two
// checkouts of the same deployment each believe they are alone — verified by
// running two of them: both started, then one sat in the 40s 409 retry loop while
// the other polled. The lock therefore has to be keyed on what Telegram actually
// serialises on: the token.

// would otherwise appear in a filename). Full digest rather than a short prefix
// because a collision here would refuse to start an unrelated bot — the opposite
